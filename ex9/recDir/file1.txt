The 1982 British military
campaign to recapture
the Falkland Islands
depended on complex
logistical arrangements.
The logistical difficulties of
operating 7,000 nautical
miles (8,100 mi; 13,000 km)
from home were formidable.
The Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands
came at a time when the Royal Navy's
amphibious capability was being
run down; but it still possessed the
aircraft carriers HMS Hermes and
Invincible, the landing platform
dock (LPD) ships HMS Fearles
 and Intrepid, and six landing ship
logistics (LSL) ships. To provide the
necessary logistic support, the Royal
Navy's ships were augmented by
ships taken up from trade (STUFT).
